# react-query-moviedb-demo
Demonstration of react-query library features using free MovieDB API

To use this demo you will need an account for MovieDB Api, you can register [here](https://www.themoviedb.org/signup).

Then change environment variable values in `env.development` file:
```
REACT_APP_USERNAME=your_username
REACT_APP_PASSWORD=your_password
```
Alterntively, you can create `env.development.local` file with aforementioned variables (this file is in `.gitignore`).
